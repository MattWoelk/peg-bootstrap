I have a new version of handaxeweb that I want to use, which supports
   multiple versions. But actually I want to rewrite it with
   peg-bootstrap itself, because a lot of its code is concerned unduly
   with parsing in a stupid way. But it’s written in Lua, and
   peg-bootstrap can’t currently generate parsers in Lua.
   Furthermore, adding that ability will probably be done much better
   with the multiple-version version of handaxeweb.

So, here’s the plan:

* Import the current Lua version of handaxeweb into this project,
   despite its crappy parsing. (done)

** Copy the files over. (done)

** Check them into Git. (done)

* Take advantage of its multi-versioning functionality to enable the parser to generate Lua code.

* Rewrite the Lua handaxeweb to use a PEG parser.
